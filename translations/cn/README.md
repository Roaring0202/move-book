# The Move Programming Language

Move is a safe and reliable language developed for blockchains by [Diem](https://diem.com/). You can read language white paper on [Diem developers website](https://developers.libra.org/docs/assets/papers/libra-move-a-language-with-programmable-resources/2019-09-26.pdf). And you can find perfect answer to why it's suited for blockchain use [here](https://community.diem.com/t/introducing-the-move-programming-language/72/45).

This book is a collection of all the information which I found and shaped into a single source of knowledge about Move language.
