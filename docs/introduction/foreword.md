# Foreword

When I wrote this book, there was no documentation (or other reference) on Move language and the goal I pursued was to give people a chance to see hidden gem of crypto world - the Move language. Currently, [there is a Move documentation](https://diem.github.io/move/introduction.html) written by language developers. Yet I still think that flow given in this book is more intuitive and more friendly for a newcomer, I once was a newcomer too and Move is one tricky and interesting language some concepts of which might be mind-blowing.

I deeply love this language and hope you'll see why!
