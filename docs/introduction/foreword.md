# Foreword

When I wrote this book, there was no documentation (or other reference) on Move language and the goal I pursued was to give people a chance to see hidden gem of crypto world - the Move language. Currently, [there is a Move documentation](https://developers.diem.com/docs/move/overview) written by language developers. Yet I still think that flow given in this book is more intuitive and more friendly for a newcomer, I once was a newcomer too and Move is one tricky and interesting language some concepts of which might be mind-blowing.

I deeply love this language and hope you'll see why!

<!-- It's been few months since we at [dfinance](https://dfinance.co) started using Libra's Move VM and Move language. Before that we worked a lot with blockchains \(and smart contracts specifically\): you may know our [Wings.ai](http://wings.ai) project - once the biggest dApp on ETH network; and we - better than many - know how hard it can be for a newcomer to work with new blockchain language, especially Rust-like, especially when blockchain environments and infrastructure challenges come to play.

That is why we are here - to help you dive into yet unknown language, and to show you its beauty.
