# Foreword

It's been few months since we at [dfinance](https://dfinance.co) started working with Libra's Move VM and Move language. Before that we worked a lot with blockchains \(and smart contracts specifically\): you may know our [Wings.ai](http://wings.ai) project - once the biggest dApp on ETH network; and we - better than many - know how hard it can be for a newcomer to work with new blockchain language, especially Rust-like, especially when blockchain environments and infrastructure challenges come to play. 

That is why we are here - to help you dive into yet unknown language, and to show you its beauty.
