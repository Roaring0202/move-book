# The Move Book

Move is a safe and reliable language developed for blockchains by [Libra](https://libra.org/). You can read language white paper on [libra developers website](https://developers.libra.org/docs/assets/papers/libra-move-a-language-with-programmable-resources/2019-09-26.pdf).

This book (or call it a resource for now) is a collection of all the information that me and my colleagues found and shaped into a single collection of knowledge about Move language.
