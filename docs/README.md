# The Move Language

Move is a safe and reliable language developed for blockchains by [Libra](https://libra.org/). You can read language white paper on [libra developers website](https://developers.libra.org/docs/assets/papers/libra-move-a-language-with-programmable-resources/2019-09-26.pdf). And you can find perfect answer to why it's suited for blockchain use [here](https://community.libra.org/t/introducing-the-move-programming-language/72/45).

This book is a collection of all the information which my colleagues and I found and shaped into a single source of knowledge about Move language.
